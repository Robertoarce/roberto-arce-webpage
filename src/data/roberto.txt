## Key Projects

### Configurable ML Pipeline
I created a comprehensive ML system that handles everything from data preprocessing to model deployment through simple YAML configuration files. This eliminates the need to rebuild machine learning pipelines from scratch for every project. The system features:
- Switch between datasets, target variables, and models without touching code
- Built-in support for 6 ML algorithms with automatic hyperparameter tuning
- Complete preprocessing pipeline handling scaling, encoding, and class imbalance
- Integrated W&B experiment tracking and model persistence
- Synthetic data generation for testing and prototyping
- Production-ready with comprehensive evaluation and validation

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Pandas, NumPy, YAML, Weights & Biases, SMOTE, Imbalanced-learn

### Pipeline Performance Benchmark
I conducted a comprehensive benchmark testing 6 different pipeline approaches for a real-world problem: calculating time-series web events that occur within 5 minutes of email marketing campaigns. The results were eye-opening:
- Traditional Pandas approaches were painfully slow
- Modern columnar processing with Polars was a game changer
- Streaming implementations achieved 10-100x performance gains

This project unlocked the true potential of ML feature engineering pipelines.

Technologies: Python, Polars, Pandas, Apache Arrow, Parquet, Concurrent Futures

### LLM-Powered Web Scraper
I developed an intelligent web scraper using LLM-powered browser automation to extract real estate listings from LebonCoin.fr. The scraper uses Google's Gemini AI (though any LLM can be used) for scraping, parsing, and extracting structured data from real estate listings. It automatically extracts property prices, surface areas in mÂ², and Paris districts (arrondissements 1-20) from web pages, converting them to clean numeric formats with robust error handling and data validation.

Technologies: Python, Browser-use, Google Gemini, Playwright, AsyncIO, JSON, CSV

### Churn Model for Beverage Distributor
I built a churn model for a beverage distributor using time-series records. The model successfully identifies revenue patterns, churn risk, and segment trends. I also developed personalized recommendations for sales reps using machine learning modeling to align with individual strengths and improve sales effectiveness.

Technologies: Jupyter, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

### Dynamic DBT Table Creation
I created a DBT script that reads database structure at compilation time and adjusts SQL queries to the structure, avoiding missing datasets/tables/values errors. This approach addresses errors arising from missing tables, misnaming sources, or neglecting to add new tables, all while dynamically aggregating tables during the repository building process. The script uses Jinja templating within DBT to handle variability in data availability across different datasets.

Technologies: Google Cloud, DBT, Jinja

### Docker Learning Challenge

Technologies: Docker, PostgreSQL, Pandas

### Sales Funnel EDA
I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on sales funnel data, analyzing sales funnel data and paid marketing channel performance. The analysis provided actionable insights and recommendations for marketing strategy optimization.

Technologies: Matplotlib, Git, Pandas, Python

### Density Estimation Techniques
I created a repository demonstrating various techniques for density estimation, which is used to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable based on observed data. The repository allows users to play with and combine different distributions and see the results, demonstrating how multiple distributions can be combined and estimated using various techniques.
